# Contributor's Guide

Below is our guidance for how to report issues, propose new features, and submit
contributions via Pull Requests (PRs).

## Before you start, file an issue

Please follow this simple rule to help us eliminate any unnecessary wasted
effort & frustration, and ensure an efficient and effective use of everyone's
time - yours, ours, and other community members':

> ðŸ‘‰ If you have a question, think you've discovered an issue, would like to
> propose a new feature, etc., then find/file an issue **BEFORE** starting work
> to fix/implement it.

## Development

### Fork, Clone, Branch and Create your PR

Once you've discussed your proposed feature/fix/etc. with a team member, and
you've agreed an approach or a spec has been written and approved, its time to
start development:

1. Fork the repo if you haven't already
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Create & push a feature branch
4. Create a
   [Draft Pull Request (PR)](https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/)
5. Work on your changes
6. Build and see if it works.

### Testing

Testing is a key component in the development workflow. If your changes affect
existing test cases, or you're working on brand new features, please ensure that
tests are updated appropriately.

### Code Review

When you'd like the team to take a look, (even if the work is not yet
fully-complete), mark the PR as 'Ready for Review' so that the team can review
your work and provide comments, suggestions, and request changes. It may take
several cycles, but the end result will be solid, testable, conformant code that
is safe for us to merge.

### Merge

Once your code has been reviewed and approved by the requisite number of team
members, it will be merged into the main branch. Once merged, your PR will be
automatically closed.
